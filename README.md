## Hotel Occupancy Forecasting using LSTM (Time Series, TensorFlow)

This project is developed to **forecast hotel occupancy rates** based on historical occupancy data. This model, which works on time series data, is built using a deep learning-based **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** architecture.

> This model is specifically developed for Giresun Asteria Hotel.
> The sample application in this repo is performed with **synthetic** data.

## Purpose

- To predict the future course of hotel occupancy rates
- To contribute to demand forecasting and resource planning processes
- To analyze seasonal and periodic trends in a data-driven manner
- To enhance the forecasting capability of hotel management in decision-making processes

## Model Features

- An LSTM architecture is used for **univariate time series forecasting**.
- The model uses historical occupancy rates to **predict the next 30 days**.
- Input sequences are created using the **sliding window** method.
- The model is built with the TensorFlow library.
